  abstract = "Super-resolution fluorescence imaging by photoactivation or
              photoswitching of single fluorophores and position determination
              (single-molecule localization microscopy, SMLM) provides
              microscopic images with subdiffraction spatial resolution. This
              technology has enabled new insights into how proteins are
              organized in a cellular context, with a spatial resolution
              approaching virtually the molecular level. A unique strength of
              SMLM is that it delivers molecule-resolved information, along
              with super-resolved images of cellular structures. This allows
              quantitative access to cellular structures, for example, how
              proteins are distributed and organized and how they interact with
              other biomolecules. Ultimately, it is even possible to determine
              protein numbers in cells and the number of subunits in a protein
              complex. SMLM thus has the potential to pave the way toward a
              better understanding of how cells function at the molecular
              level. In this review, we describe how SMLM has contributed new
              knowledge in eukaryotic biology, and we specifically focus on
              quantitative biological data extracted from SMLM images.",
