	abstract = {One of the most common swimming strategies employed by microorganisms is based on the use of rotating helical filaments, called flagella, that are powered by molecular motors. Determining the physical properties of this propulsive system is crucial to understanding the behavior of these organisms. Furthermore, the ability to dynamically monitor the activity of the flagellar motor is a valuable indicator of the overall energetics of the cell. In this work, inherently magnetic bacteria confined in micromagnetic CoFe traps are used to directly and noninvasively determine the flagellar thrust force and swimming speed of motile cells. The technique permits determination of the ratio of propulsive force/swimming speed (the hydrodynamic resistance) and the power output of the flagellar motor for individual cells over extended time periods. Cells subjected to ultraviolet radiation are observed to experience exponential decays in power output as a function of exposure time. By noninvasively measuring thrust, velocity, and power output over time at a single-cell level, this technique can serve as the foundation for fundamental studies of bacterial hydrodynamics and also provides a novel, to our knowledge, tether-free probe of single-cell energetics over time.},

abstract = {The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is responsible for driving bacterial locomotion and chemotaxis, fundamental processes in pathogenesis and biofilm formation. In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface between transmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well established that the passage of ions down a transmembrane gradient through the stator complex provides the energy for torque generation. However, the physics involved in this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here we propose a mechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM. In particular, we identify roles for two fundamental forces involved in torque generation: electrostatic and steric. We propose that electrostatic forces serve to position the stator, whereas steric forces comprise the actual “power stroke.” Specifically, we propose that ion-induced conformational changes about a proline “hinge” residue in a stator α-helix are directly responsible for generating the power stroke. Our model predictions fit well with recent experiments on a single-stator motor. The proposed model provides a mechanical explanation for several fundamental properties of the flagellar motor, including torque–speed and speed–ion motive force relationships, backstepping, variation in step sizes, and the effects of key mutations in the stator.}}

	abstract = {The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is a rotary molecular motor embedded in the cell membrane of numerous bacteria. It turns a flagellum which acts as a propeller, enabling bacterial motility and chemotaxis. The BFM is rotated by stator units, inner membrane protein complexes that stochastically associate to and dissociate from individual motors at a rate which depends on the mechanical and electrochemical environment. Stator units consume the ion motive force (IMF), the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane that results from cellular respiration, converting the electrochemical energy of translocated ions into mechanical energy, imparted to the rotor. Here, we review some of the main results that form the base of our current understanding of the relationship between the IMF and the functioning of the flagellar motor. We examine a series of studies that establish a linear proportionality between IMF and motor speed, and we discuss more recent evidence that the stator units sense the IMF, altering their rates of dynamic assembly. This, in turn, raises the question of to what degree the classical dependence of motor speed on IMF is due to stator dynamics vs. the rate of ion flow through the stators. Finally, while long assumed to be static and homogeneous, there is mounting evidence that the IMF is dynamic, and that its fluctuations control important phenomena such as cell-to-cell signaling and mechanotransduction. Within the growing toolbox of single cell bacterial electrophysiology, one of the best tools to probe IMF fluctuations may, ironically, be the motor that consumes it. Perfecting our incomplete understanding of how the BFM employs the energy of ion flow will help decipher the dynamical behavior of the bacterial IMF.},

Abstract

Rotary motors of bacterial flagella are driven by ions that move across the cytoplasmic membrane down an electrochemical gradient. For Escherichia coli, the ions are protons, and the maximum work per unit charge that they can do is the protonmotive force. To test whether motor efficiency is limited by proton leakage or mechanical nonlinearities, we measured torque as a function of protonmotive force. Filamentous cells were drawn into micropipettes and energized with an external voltage source. Torque was proportional to protonmotive force up to -150 mV, twice the span accessible by earlier techniques. This is consistent with a mechanism in which a fixed number of protons, working at unit efficiency, carry the motor through each revolution. We also found that individual torque-generating elements inactivate at low potentials or potentials of reverse sign. When normal potentials are restored, they reactivate sequentially. },

The discrete Shifrin method is used to calculate the extinction cross section of the finite cylinders. The results indicate that the relative refractive index is practically independent of the wavelength of the incident radiation in the range from 0.4 micrometers to 0.8 micrometers . The mean value of 1.0387 in this range corresponds to the absolute refractive index value equal to 1.384 at 0.589 micrometers . The obtained value of refractive index of E. coli cells is somewhat lower than the result of immersion refractometry measured by Bryant et al.},
