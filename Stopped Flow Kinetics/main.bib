	abstract = {To attain functionality, proteins must fold into their three-dimensional native state. The intracellular balance between protein synthesis, folding, and degradation is constantly challenged by genetic or environmental stress factors. In the last ten years, protein misfolding induced by missense mutations was demonstrated to be the seminal molecular mechanism in a constantly growing number of inborn errors of metabolism. In these cases, loss of protein function results from early degradation of missense-induced misfolded proteins. Increasing knowledge on the proteostasis network and the protein quality control system with distinct mechanisms in different compartments of the cell paved the way for the development of new treatment strategies for conformational diseases using small molecules. These comprise proteostasis regulators that enhance the capacity of the proteostasis network and pharmacological chaperones that specifically bind and rescue misfolded proteins by conformational stabilization. They can be used either alone or in combination, the latter to exploit synergistic effects. Many of these small molecule compounds currently undergo preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical development and two have been approved: saproterin dihydrochloride for the treatment of phenylketonuria and tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis. Different technologies are exploited for the discovery of new small molecule compounds that belong to the still young class of pharmaceutical products discussed here. These compounds may in the near future improve existing treatment strategies or even offer a first-time treatment to patients suffering from nowadays-untreatable inborn errors of metabolism.},

Hen egg-white lysozyme has been crystallized at slightly alkaline pH using 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) as the precipitant. The crystals are nearly isomorphous to crystals grown at acidic pH using sodium chloride as the precipitant. However, the growth kinetics differ markedly between the two conditions. The major reason for this is a molecule of MPD that binds tightly in between two lysozyme molecules and favors the growth of the crystals along the crystallographic c direction over growth perpendicular to it.

	abstract = {The early events in the life of newly synthesized proteins in the cellular environment are remarkably complex. Concurrently with their synthesis by the ribosome, nascent polypeptides are subjected to enzymatic processing, chaperone-assisted folding or targeting to translocation pores at membranes. The ribosome itself has a key role in these different tasks and governs the interplay between the various factors involved. Indeed, the ribosome serves as a platform for the spatially and temporally regulated association of enzymes, targeting factors and chaperones that act upon the nascent polypeptides emerging from the exit tunnel. Furthermore, the ribosome provides opportunities to coordinate the protein-synthesis activity of its peptidyl transferase center with the protein targeting and folding processes. Here we review the early co-translational events involving the ribosome that guide cytosolic proteins to their native state.},

	abstract = {The structural biology of co-translational protein folding on the ribosome is reviewed., Protein folding, a process that underpins cellular activity, begins co-translationally on the ribosome. During translation, a newly synthesized polypeptide chain enters the ribosomal exit tunnel and actively interacts with the ribosome elements – the r-proteins and rRNA that line the tunnel – prior to emerging into the cellular milieu. While understanding of the structure and function of the ribosome has advanced significantly, little is known about the process of folding of the emerging nascent chain (NC). Advances in cryo-electron microscopy are enabling visualization of NCs within the exit tunnel, allowing early glimpses of the interplay between the NC and the ribosome. Once it has emerged from the exit tunnel into the cytosol, the NC (still attached to its parent ribosome) can acquire a range of conformations, which can be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Using experimental restraints within molecular-dynamics simulations, the ensemble of NC structures can be described. In order to delineate the process of co-translational protein folding, a hybrid structural biology approach is foreseeable, potentially offering a complete atomic description of protein folding as it occurs on the ribosome.},
