	abstract = {Over the past 15 years or so, numerous studies have sought to characterise how nuclear calcium (Ca2+) signals are generated and reversed, and to understand how events that occur in the nucleoplasm influence cellular Ca2+ activity, and vice versa. In this Commentary, we describe mechanisms of nuclear Ca2+ signalling and discuss what is known about the origin and physiological significance of nuclear Ca2+ transients. In particular, we focus on the idea that the nucleus has an autonomous Ca2+ signalling system that can generate its own Ca2+ transients that modulate processes such as gene transcription. We also discuss the role of nuclear pores and the nuclear envelope in controlling ion flux into the nucleoplasm.},

	abstract = {In fura-2-loaded ECV304 cells ionomycin elicited a saturable biphasic change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), where the initial phase represented mobilization of intracellular stores and the sustained component represented Ca2+ influx. To examine whether ionomycin could stimulate influx via a store-dependent mechanism. Mn2+ entry was monitored by the quenching of fura-2 fluorescence: influx was enhanced even after ionomycin wash-out, provided that internal stores were not refilled with Ca2+. Moreover, the maximal rate of histamine-stimulated Mn2+ entry was unaffected by ionomycin, suggesting a common route of entry. The Ca(2+)-entry blocker SK\&F 96365 inhibited both the ionomycin-induced Mn2+ entry and the sustained [Ca2+]i response to the ionophore (leaving the initial peak [Ca2+]i response unaffected). In other experiments, although addition of ionomycin further increased the plateau phase induced by 100 microM histamine, the increase was completely abolished by pretreatment with the store Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Furthermore, in store-depleted cells, re-addition of 1 mM extracellular Ca2+ (in the presence of CPA plus histamine) led to a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i, dependent on Ca2+ influx, with kinetics that were not enhanced by ionomycin. These data suggest that ionomycin acts primarily at the level of the internal Ca2+ stores, so that, at the concentrations used here ({\textless} or = 1 microM), it increases Ca2+ (and Mn2+) influx via activation of endogenous entry pathways and not by plasmalemmal translocation.},

	abstract = {The effect of histamine on intracellular free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+](i)) in MG63 human osteosarcoma cells was explored using fura-2 as a Ca2+ dye. Histamine increased ([Ca2+](i)) in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC(50) value of 0.5 microM. Extracellular Ca2+ removal inhibited the ([Ca2+](i)) signals. Histamine failed to increase ([Ca2+](i)) in Ca2+-free medium after cells were pretreated with thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor). Addition of Ca2+ induced concentration-dependent ([Ca2+](i)) increases after preincubation with histamine in Ca2+-free medium. Histamine-induced intracellular Ca2+ release was abolished by inhibiting phospholipase C with 1-(6-((17beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122). The ([Ca2+](i)) increase induced by histamine in Ca2+ medium was abolished by cimetidine, but was not altered by pyrilamine, nifedipine, verapamil, and La(3+). Together, this study shows that histamine increased in ([Ca2+](i)) in osteosarcoma cells by stimulating H2 histamine receptors. The Ca2+ signal was caused by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a phospholipase C-dependent manner. The Ca2+ release was accompanied by Ca(2+) influx.},
